## [2026-03-02 17:05 +0400] - US-001: Port legacy Discord vote embed format into new bot send route
Thread: 
Run: 20260302-170037-35578 (iteration 1)
Run log: /Volumes/Data/gmgame/gmgame-site-backend/.ralph/runs/run-20260302-170037-35578-iter-1.log

- Guardrails reviewed: yes
- No-commit run: false
- Commit: 874f5da chore(workspace): capture run state
- Post-commit status: `clean`
- Verification:
  - Command: npm test -> PASS
  - Command: npm run lint -> FAIL
  - Command: npm run build -> PASS
- Files changed:
  - ../GMGameBot/routes.js
  - .ralph/activity.log
  - .ralph/progress.md
- What was implemented
  - Updated `POST /send_embed` in `../GMGameBot/routes.js` to include monitoring-aware text in Discord message content: `${params.username} проголосовал на мониторинге ${params.monitoring}!`.
  - Added fallback for missing `monitoring` to exactly `на одном из мониторингов`, producing `${params.username} проголосовал на одном из мониторингов!`.
  - Kept legacy embed title/description and button labels/URLs unchanged, and did not introduce RCON/random reward/prize issuance logic.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered
  - Current bot route already matched legacy button set and embed shell; only monitoring text fallback was missing.
  - Gotchas encountered
  - `../GMGameBot` is outside this repository, so functional story code change is external to repo-root git history.
  - Useful context
  - Backend lint currently fails with pre-existing ESLint errors unrelated to US-001.

## [2026-03-02 17:08 +0400] - US-002: Keep send_embed payload compatibility and add username guard
Thread: 
Run: 20260302-170037-35578 (iteration 2)

- Commit: 4c22d32 chore(ralph): record US-002 run artifacts
- Post-commit status: `clean`
- Verification:
  - Command: npm test -> PASS
  - Command: npm run lint -> FAIL
  - Command: npm run build -> PASS
- Files changed:
  - ../GMGameBot/routes.js
  - .ralph/activity.log
  - .ralph/progress.md
- What was implemented
  - Updated `POST /send_embed` in `../GMGameBot/routes.js` to normalize `username` and preserve compatibility with payloads that only include `username`.
  - Added username guard: when `username` is empty string, null, undefined, or whitespace-only, route now uses fallback display name `Игрок`.
  - Applied normalized username in both message content and embed title so positive and negative compatibility cases render correctly without route errors.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered
  - Bot route compatibility changes can be implemented in `../GMGameBot` while run tracking and commits remain in this repo.
  - Gotchas encountered
  - `npm run lint` fails due to pre-existing issues in unrelated files; story changes did not introduce new lint failures.
  - Useful context
  - Required activity logging is available through `ralph log "message"`.

## [2026-03-02 17:14 +0400] - US-003: Propagate monitoring from site vote flow to bot API
Thread: 
Run: 20260302-170037-35578 (iteration 3)
Run log: /Volumes/Data/gmgame/gmgame-site-backend/.ralph/runs/run-20260302-170037-35578-iter-3.log

- Post-commit status: `clean`

  - src/external-api/external-api.service.ts

  - .ralph/runs/run-20260302-170037-35578-iter-2.md
- What was implemented
  - Updated vote handler flow to pass `monitoring` from validated vote context into `applyVoteReward` and include it in `send_embed` payload only when present.
  - Kept reward behavior unchanged: still sends `prize: 'money'`, looks up user by username, and increments balance by 5.
  - Expanded vote_handler e2e coverage to assert positive payload includes both `username` and `monitoring`, and negative path without monitoring still succeeds and updates balance.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered
  - Vote validation already provides monitoring for known formats; optional payload spreading keeps backward compatibility if monitoring is absent.
  - Gotchas encountered
  - `npm run lint` continues to fail on pre-existing unrelated files (`admin`, `auth`, `main`) and not on US-003 files.
  - Useful context
  - Activity logging helper path in this repo is `./.agents/ralph/log-activity.sh`.

## [2026-03-02 17:18 +0400] - US-004: Add automated tests for compatibility scenarios
Thread: 
Run: 20260302-170037-35578 (iteration 4)

  - .ralph/guardrails.md
  - .ralph/runs/run-20260302-170037-35578-iter-3.md
  - src/external-api/external-api.vote-handler.e2e.spec.ts
- What was implemented
  - Added explicit compatibility coverage in `external-api.vote-handler.e2e.spec.ts` for username-only payload handling with backward-compatible `send_embed` payload (`username` + `prize`) and intact reward balance update path.
  - Added negative-path coverage to verify missing monitoring remains optional and does not throw, while still sending embed payload and applying reward update.
  - Preserved reward invariants in tests by asserting no award-creation path regression and confirming balance increments remain unchanged.
  - Recorded repeated baseline lint failure in `.ralph/errors.log` and added a scoped-lint guardrail sign in `.ralph/guardrails.md`.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered
  - `voteHandler` compatibility cases can be exercised safely by stubbing `validateWithDebug` and asserting `sendToBot` payload shape directly.
  - Gotchas encountered
  - Global lint gate still fails due unrelated baseline files (`admin`, `auth`, `main`), so story-scope lint cleanliness must be tracked separately.
  - Useful context
  - Activity logging command is available as `ralph log "message"` (not `./ralph`).
